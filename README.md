## Features left to Implement
* When there is time, I would like to add more questions and a function to randomise the quiz questions loading a new set everytime the user hits the 
  Reload quiz button

# Testing

* Tested website perfomance and usability in different browsers i.e. Chrome, firefox and safari. 
* Tested website responsiveness on different device-sizes i.e. mobile, tablet and desktop.
* Tested the site navigation to ensure all buttons are visible, with consistent design and in working order on all pages.
* Tested all website content to ensure it is legible and without spelling or grammatical errors.

## Bugs
### Solved bugs
* After deploying my website to github pages, the background images were not loading leaving the background bare. I discovered this was because my CSS    
  syntax for the background image was wrong. 
   * Instead of "background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.5), rgba(0,0,0,0.5)), url(../images/page1.jpg);", 
  i had "background-image: linear-gradient(rgba (0,0,0,0.5), rgba(0,0,0,0.5)), url(Assets/images/page1.jpg);"

* I got several warnings advising that a lot of my javascript code was only available in ES6 (use 'esversion:6) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)", when i 
   added the JS code to JSHint for valitation.
   * To eliminate the warnings, i added the following comment '/*jshint esversion: 6 */' at the top of the javascipt code

### Unsolved bugs
* There are no unsolved bugs
